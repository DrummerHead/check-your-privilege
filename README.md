# Check your privilege in one easy step!

Parody little page. The most interesting thing about this is the checkbox emulation, since rendering big checkboxes is not natively possible. Check this CSS line if you want to grab the checkbox styling. The other part of the equation is being compliant with the [WAI-ARIA checkbox role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_checkbox_role?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Accessibility%2FARIA%2FARIA_Techniques%2FUsing_the_checkbox_role).

The second interesting thing is how the site font-size is tied to the viewport with, so the content "scales" to viewport width. I did something similar in this [meme project](https://github.com/DrummerHead/meme/).
